Hi, this is Blue.

I've been developing Not Quite Nitro since April 2019 and since then it's gotten loads more features.
This'll be the last message from me unless you decide to re-add me to your server, but first, there's one thing I would like to ask from you:

I really want to know what you thought about my bot, and what I could do to make it fit __your__ server better.
If you don't mind, I've set up a feedback form on my website which you can fill out here:
<https://nqn.blue/feedback?guild_id=666122742965207060>
It should only take a minute at most but it would really help me work out how to improve NQN.

Thanks for trying my bot,
Blue
