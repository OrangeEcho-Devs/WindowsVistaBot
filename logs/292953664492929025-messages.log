I require the permissions: `Embed links, Use external emojis`.

Make sure to check all the other roles I have for that permission and remember to check channel-specific permissions.
Thank you.

My command prefix is `!` or `u!`
Example: `!help`

You can also mention the bot instead of using a prefix. 
Example: `@UnbelievaBoat#1046 help`
